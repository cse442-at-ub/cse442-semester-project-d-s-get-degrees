{"str": "**Valorant: the Next Big Esport?**\n\n_Valorant_ is looking to make a big impact in the Esports scene. The game is in closed beta, and has already attracted the audience of top streamers, professional players, and competitive organizations. Even before the closed beta, some professional _Counter Strike_ and _Overwatch_ players announced their retirement from their respective games to go play _Valorant_ professionally. Streamers like TimTheTatman, Shroud, Summit1G and Ninja have been playing the game almost nonstop since the release of the beta. The game has even attracted 100 Thieves, who hosted a _Valorant_ Closed Beta Tournament featuring Goldenboy and Rivington as commentators, professional streamers such as Shroud, TimTheTatman, CouRage, Nadeshot, Dr. Disrespect and Ninja along with professional gamers like Skadoodle, fl0m, Aceu, Hiko, Kephrii, and Stewie2k.\n[#UBEsport](/blog?tag=UBEsport)", "tags": ["#UBEsport"]}

**Overwatch's Newest Hero Recently Released**

After a long period of teases and references, Echo is finally here in _Overwatch_. She’s a robot powered by a special AI developed by _Overwatch_. Echo is a damage character, with 200 base health. Here are the abilities:
Echo’s primary fire is a Tri-Shot, which is a projectile that does 51 damage per shot. Her alternate fire is Sticky Bombs, which fires six bombs per shot and does a maximum of 150 damage. The sticky bombs have a six second cooldown.
Echo’s movement ability is Flight, which allows Echo to move for three seconds. The cooldown on Flight is six seconds.
Another ability Echo has is Focusing Beam. This beam does more damage when the enemy is less than half health. The beam has a range of 20 meters, it lasts 2.5 seconds, and has an eight second cooldown.
Echo’s ultimate ability, Duplicate, allows her to transform to any enemy hero and gain a big increase in ultimate ability generation.
We’re excited to test out Echos abilities in game. We’re also excited to see how her introduction will change up the meta of the game. We’re keeping a close eye on the pros and what sort of team compositions they come up with.
